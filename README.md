When the company began they around $1 billion dollars, much coming from powerful individuals like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  

OpenAI was created "because of its founders' existential concerns about the potential for catastrophe resulting from carelessness and misuse of general-purpose AI. The company has a long-term focus on fundamental advances in AI and its capabilities." Founders such as Elon Musk are afraid of AI turning on humanity and causing us great harm, OpenAI's goal is produce AGI for the benefit of humanity and keep AI or AGI from being to concentrated in one place. The company does not state goals more specifically. The company offers an advanced chat bot(AI-powered Large Language Model) and more recently an image generator.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  

Anyone and everyone is the intended customer of OpenAI. According to their charter accessible on their website their primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. They are working to generate AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all people. Right now estimates on the number of users is around 180 million with around 1% of them paying for a montly subscription to ChatGPT Plus.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  

The company's chatbot is head and shoulders above what else is out there. There have been chat bots for many years and other companies offer them but none have been as advanced as ChatGPT. The model can functional at a high level. Its had the ability to understand context, detail, and recognize when it has makes mistakes. It has a special ability answer questions in the style of someone famous or take the role of someone designated by the user. For example you can get responses in the style of Dr. Seuss or as a professional looking to hire a certain type of employee. It's imagine generator can create some realistic looking images but still has much room for improvement. That being said all you need is a description to get images created just for you.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

OpenAI is mainly focused on utilizing AI, with the eventual goal of producing AGI. According to a Hackernoon article ChatGPT is "a deep learning model capable of creating human-like language...one of the core technologies developed by OpenAI. GPT is based on a language processing architecture called a transformer, which allows it to understand and produce natural language with remarkable accuracy and coherence.
OpenAI technology also includes reinforcement learning and machine learning, enabling AI agents to learn from experience and improve their decision-making skills over time. This technology has been applied to various applications, including robotics, gaming, and autonomous driving." DALL-E the image generator leverages a transformer neural network, another type of AI, which is specifically the GPT-3 architecture. The image generator was initially trained on over 12 million images.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

The company is in the field of artificial intelligence with the goal of eventually creating a form of artifical general intelligence. Users can either interact with its chat bot, ChatGPT or image generator, DALL-E.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

Chatbots have expanded into many facets in our lives. In recent memory many companies have used online service bots as the front line of customer service. These have improved over the years with varying degrees of success. In our homes we have virtual assistants such as Alexa who use language models just like ChatGPT. They are getting better at understanding questions and quering appropriate responses. Image generation on the other hand has been trickier and didn't have much of a presence until recently. DALL-E first came onto the scene in early 2021 with its 3rd itereation currently available. The technology has improved drastically. Some images can appear realistic but no image generator is quite perfect. People and placing letters/numbers in images can be tough. Even now images that are suppose to be realistic will have tells in them that can be identified. Although it is only a matter of time before we won't be able to distinguish between real and generated images.

* What are the other major companies in this field?

When it comes to image generation a couple alternatives to OpenAI are Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Midjourney requires a subscription but is liked for its ability to create detailed and high quality images. Stable Diffusion is free to use and was developed by multiple groups and organizations like Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, StabilityAI, and RunwayML. There are plenty of competitors out there when it comes to chat bots. Many smaller companies have models but two major competitors are Google and Microsoft. Google's Bard is exceptionally fast but lower in accuracy. Microsft's Bing can anwswer questions as a chat bot and one of its perks that OpenAI doesn't have is that it can actively search the internet. There is a tradeoff for speed but you won't have to worry about asking questions on more recent matters. ChatGPT has a cut off date for which it is trained.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  OpenAI is a leader in the field of intelligence. The company's success has led to many start-ups and even larger companies trying to imitate their success. Right now for example, Google's Bard is lacking in accuracy compared to ChatGpt. That being said sometimes ChatGPT gives answers that are not totally correct. The drive the OpenAI is creating will lead others to try their hand at AGI and likely lead to many improvements in the field. Another, perhaps more drastic affect, is how the large language model will affect schooling and white collar work. A lawyer named Steven Shwartz used the chat bot which provided an argument using fake cases. When asked to defend his choice he claimed he thought it was a serach engine, lawyers right?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

According to OpenAI the metrics the company uses to measure its success is impact on AI safety, AI research, technical leadership, deployment of benefical AI, public perception and collaboration, and ethical/safety standards. Broadley speaking as of now OpenAi is meeting these standards. They have kept AI safe, led in research, led with their technologies, provided AI that has been useful, had a generally positive public preception and upheld their ethical/safety standards. Like the change of technology one event could also change their public perception. If it is found out someone or some government is using their prodcuts for nefarious ends they might not be as well recieved.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

OpenAI is leading the field in large language models and image generation. They boast many users and have the most advanced models currently available. They are ahead of everyone else today but that doesn't mean their dominance will persist. Technology changes rapidly and one big advancement by any firm in the field could replace them.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
